<!-- CSS Media Queries -->
The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.
Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
•	width and height of the viewport
•	orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait)
•	resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

<!-- Example: -->
<head>
<style>
body
{
background-color:red;
margin:0px;
padding:170px;
text-align:center;
font-weight:bolder;
font-size:20px;
}

@media screen and (min-width:300px) and (max-width:500px)
{
body{
background-color:green;
}
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Rama Krishna</p>
</body>
